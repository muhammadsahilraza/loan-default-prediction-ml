## Project Summary

This project predicts whether a loan will be fully paid or default using real-world financial data from Kaggle. The objective is to assist lenders in identifying high-risk borrowers using machine learning.

We achieved:
- ✅ 84% accuracy using Random Forest & XGBoost
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- ✅ Proper handling of class imbalance
- ✅ Feature importance visualization for interpretability

### Why 84% Accuracy is Good

Achieving 90%+ accuracy in real-world financial datasets is unrealistic without deeper behavioral, transactional, or credit bureau data. This dataset includes only basic loan attributes, which limits prediction power.

Still, 84% accuracy is strong performance for:
- A **real Kaggle dataset**
- An **interpretable, production-ready pipeline**
- A use case where **precision, recall, and business context** matter more than raw accuracy

This project is designed for reliability, transparency, and practical deployment — exactly what financial clients value in loan default prediction models.
